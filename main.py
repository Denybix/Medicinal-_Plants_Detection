    Welcome to the Medicinal Plant Detection System! üåøüîç

    Our mission is to empower you to identify medicinal plants and discover their uses. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to reveal its potential medicinal properties. Together, let's unlock the power of nature's pharmacy!

    ### How It Works

    **Upload Image**: Go to the Detect Plant page and upload an image.
    **Analysis**: Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify the medicinal plant and provide information on its traditional uses.
    **Results**: View the results and explore recommendations for further research or responsible use.
   
    ### Why Choose Us?

    **Accuracy**: Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for reliable medicinal plant identification.
    **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    **Fast and Efficient**: Receive results in seconds, allowing you to explore the world of medicinal plants quickly.

    Click on the Medicinal Plant Detection page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our system!
